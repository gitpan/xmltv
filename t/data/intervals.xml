<!-- Test filtering by 'what is on / missed / to come at a given
time'.  This means some programmes with both times, and some with only
start time.

Note that for any programme, there is always some time when it is on
both 'before' and 'after' that time, ie some instant when it is
showing.  (This is even true for the pathological case of a
zero-length programme.)
